Description: |
  QUIK is an open source replacement for the stock messaging app on Android.
  It displays SMS/MMS conversations, supports scheduled sends, backups, voice
  messages, speech-to-text and text-to-speech, and more.  
  QUIK connects to public APIs (e.g. Space Devs) for news and may fetch
  thumbnails from third-party hosts, so itâ€™s marked as NonFreeNet.
